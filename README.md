# PPOL 5203 - Problem Set 2

This repository contains your second problem set for Data Science I: Foundations. 

**Deadline:** 11:59pm of October 11

## General Rules for Problem Sets


- (i) all code must run;

- (ii) solutions should be readable

    -   Code should be thoroughly commented (the Professor/TA should be able to understand the codes purpose by reading the comment),
    -   Coding solutions should be broken up into individual code chunks in Jupyter/R Markdown notebooks, not clumped together into one large code chunk (See examples in class or reach out to the TA/Professor if this is unclear),
    -   Each student defined function must contain a doc string explaining what the function does, each input argument, and what the function returns;


- (iii) Commentary, responses, and/or solutions should all be written in Markdown and explain sufficiently the outpus.

- (iv) All solutions  must be completed in Python.


There is not Python in this problem set. So take these rules as a general instructions. 


## Step by Step for the Problem Set. 

You should be familiar with the steps required to work on this repository. If not, you will be after completing this assignment and in-class exercise. 

If you follow the steps below, you should be able to solve all required tasks. 

## Working locally in your assignment


### step 1

First step is to clone your assignment to your local machine

```
git clone <repository_name>
```

This will create a folder in your local working directory. This folder is a local github repository. You should `cd` into that folder. 

### step 2

Your problem set which is fully describe in the notebook `_ps_set2.ipynb`. 

You can open `ipynb` using jupyter notebooks. 

Read you assignment carefully. 

You will be required to provide responses in the notebook and also creating new folderes in this repository. 


### step 3

Submit your assignment via github, via stagging, commit and push. 

- Remember: this is a individual assignment.
- Your deadline for submission is Friday, October 11, until midnight
- I will consider your last commit as your final submission.
- Save your notebook as `<_yourname__ps_set2.ipynb>`


If you have any questions, ask me or your TA. Feel also free to open an issue in the [template repository](https://github.com/PPOL-5203-2023/pset_02) for this problem set


Enjoy!!
